<h1>Exoplanet CMS (ECMS)</h1>

Exoplanet CMS (ECMS) is an experimental single-page content management system based on WebGL.
  
  ECMS is still under development - it currently only consists of the frontend and configuration and content can be provided by inserting it into the main html and config file.
  
  Browser compatibility has been tested for Chrome 47 and Firefox 43, it is however not (yet) intended to be used with older browsers or mobile systems. 
  
  ECMS is using the fantastic Three.js ( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/ ) library as well as the HTML5 Dialog-Element polyfill by GoogleChrome ( https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill ). Planet textures are created with the help of the Donjon SciFi World Creator ( http://donjon.bin.sh/scifi/world/ ).
   
   
<h2>Installation</h2>

Nothing to install - just put the contents of this repository on some webserver, add content to index.html and configure your planets in conf.js.
